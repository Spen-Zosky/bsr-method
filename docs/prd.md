# Product Requirements Document

**Project**: BSR Method
**Date**: 2026-02-08
**Status**: Draft

## 1. Executive Summary

### Vision
AI-driven development framework integrating BMAD, SpecKit, and Ralph

### Problem
Software development with LLMs lacks a structured methodology. Developers jump between planning, coding, and testing without a coherent workflow. Existing tools are fragmented - planning tools don't connect to spec generators, spec generators don't connect to task managers, and task managers don't connect to LLM executors. BSR Method solves this by providing an end-to-end pipeline from idea to implementation.


### Target Users
Solo developers using AI-assisted development,Small teams wanting structured LLM-driven workflows,Developers working on greenfield and brownfield projects
