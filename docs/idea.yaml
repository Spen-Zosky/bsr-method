name: BSR Method
tagline: AI-driven development framework integrating BMAD, SpecKit, and Ralph
domain: Developer Tools / CLI Framework
problemStatement: >
  Software development with LLMs lacks a structured methodology. Developers jump
  between planning, coding, and testing without a coherent workflow. Existing
  tools are fragmented - planning tools don't connect to spec generators, spec
  generators don't connect to task managers, and task managers don't connect to
  LLM executors. BSR Method solves this by providing an end-to-end pipeline from
  idea to implementation.
targetUsers:
  - Solo developers using AI-assisted development
  - Small teams wanting structured LLM-driven workflows
  - Developers working on greenfield and brownfield projects
coreFeatures:
  - CLI with 11 commands covering the full development lifecycle
  - "BMAD planning phase: idea -> PRD -> architecture"
  - "SpecKit specification phase: constitution, feature specs, API specs"
  - "Ralph execution loop: LLM-powered task implementation"
  - "Brownfield discovery: analyze existing codebases"
  - Task breakdown with dependencies and priority
  - Web dashboard for task visualization
  - MCP server for Claude Desktop integration
  - Multi-LLM support (Claude, OpenAI)
  - Export to markdown, HTML, PDF
techPreferences:
  runtime: Node.js 18+
  language: TypeScript
  build: tsup + turbo (monorepo)
  testing: vitest
  linting: ESLint 9 (flat config) + Prettier
  architecture: Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
  packages:
    - "@bsr-method/shared - Shared types and utilities"
    - "@bsr-method/core - Core engine"
    - bsr-method (cli) - CLI commands and MCP server
    - "@bsr-method/bmad-adapter - BMAD document parser/transformer"
    - "@bsr-method/speckit-adapter - Spec generator/validator"
    - "@bsr-method/dashboard - Web UI for task management"
constraints:
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing .bsr/ configs
  - CLI must work without API keys (offline-first, LLM optional)
  - Zero runtime dependencies where possible in core/shared
  - Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
