# BSR Method

> AI-driven development framework integrating BMAD, SpecKit, and Ralph

## Overview
- **Domain**: Developer Tools / CLI Framework
- **Target Users**: Solo developers using AI-assisted development,Small teams wanting structured LLM-driven workflows,Developers working on greenfield and brownfield projects

## Problem Statement
Software development with LLMs lacks a structured methodology. Developers jump between planning, coding, and testing without a coherent workflow. Existing tools are fragmented - planning tools don't connect to spec generators, spec generators don't connect to task managers, and task managers don't connect to LLM executors. BSR Method solves this by providing an end-to-end pipeline from idea to implementation.


## Core Features
- CLI with 11 commands covering the full development lifecycle
- BMAD planning phase: idea -> PRD -> architecture
- SpecKit specification phase: constitution, feature specs, API specs
- Ralph execution loop: LLM-powered task implementation
- Brownfield discovery: analyze existing codebases
- Task breakdown with dependencies and priority
- Web dashboard for task visualization
- MCP server for Claude Desktop integration
- Multi-LLM support (Claude, OpenAI)
- Export to markdown, HTML, PDF

## Technical Preferences
[object Object]

## Constraints
Maintain backward compatibility with existing .bsr/ configs,CLI must work without API keys (offline-first, LLM optional),Zero runtime dependencies where possible in core/shared,Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
